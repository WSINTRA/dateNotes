User can login and fetch all saved notes,
Create new user is working, login to be done
Display current days note

Things to think about, the notepad must change as the date changes,
each day is a new notepad,
So think of it like this, when a user scrolls or clicks a date they have previously saved something the value in the note textarea should be the previous entry.
Entries therefore must be based on the date of entry
